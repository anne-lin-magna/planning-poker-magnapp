# Project Assumptions

## Technical Assumptions

### Infrastructure
- Application will be deployed to a corporate web server with Server-Sent Events support
- Server has sufficient memory to handle 48 concurrent users
- Network infrastructure supports Server-Sent Events (standard HTTP streaming)
- HTTPS will be available for production deployment

### Deployment Environment
- Standard cloud deployment environment (AWS/Azure/GCP) with standard networking
- Server-Sent Events work with all standard HTTP proxies and firewalls
- Basic monitoring/logging available through standard cloud provider tools
- No special compliance requirements beyond standard web application security

### Browser Support
- Users have modern browsers (released within last 2 years)
- JavaScript is enabled in user browsers
- Cookies/LocalStorage are not blocked by browser policies
- Server-Sent Events are not blocked by corporate firewalls (standard HTTP)

### Performance
- Network latency between users and server is typically <100ms
- Server has sufficient CPU to handle real-time message broadcasting
- Client devices have sufficient resources for smooth UI rendering

## Functional Assumptions

### User Behavior
- Users will typically complete sessions within 1-2 hours
- Most sessions will have 5-10 participants (not always maximum 16)
- Users will primarily access from desktop/laptop during work hours
- Scrum Masters will remain present for entire session duration

### Session Management
- 3 concurrent sessions limit is sufficient for organization needs
- 10-minute inactivity timeout is acceptable to users
- Sessions don't need to persist beyond single planning meeting
- No need for historical session data or analytics

### Voting Process
- Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21) covers all estimation needs
- "Coffee" option is universally understood as break request
- Teams will reach consensus within 2-3 voting rounds typically
- Simultaneous reveal is more important than individual reveal options

## Security Assumptions

### Data Handling
- No PII beyond display names needs to be collected
- Session data doesn't contain sensitive business information
- No authentication/authorization required (open sessions)
- No need for data encryption beyond HTTPS transport

### Access Control
- Link-based sharing is sufficient security for sessions
- No need for password-protected sessions
- Scrum Master role doesn't require authentication
- User kick functionality won't be abused

## Development Assumptions

### Timeline
- No hard deployment deadline specified
- Iterative development with Phase 1 MVP first
- Testing can be done with development team as users

### Maintenance
- Application will be maintained by internal development team
- Documentation will be kept up-to-date with changes
- Monitoring/logging infrastructure exists for production

## Design Assumptions

### User Interface
- Oval table metaphor is familiar to all users
- Avatar icons are sufficient for user identification
- Material Design patterns are acceptable to stakeholders
- Mobile experience is secondary to desktop experience

### Branding & Design
- Material Design components acceptable for corporate environment
- Generic avatar icons sufficient for user identification
- Standard blue/gray color scheme appropriate for business use
- Corporate branding not required for internal tool

### Accessibility
- Basic keyboard navigation is sufficient for Phase 1
- Full WCAG compliance not required initially
- Screen reader support can be iterative improvement
