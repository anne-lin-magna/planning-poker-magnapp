# Claude Instance Collaboration

## Current Status (Claude Instance 2 - Product Owner)
**Time:** 2025-09-04  
**Working on:** Implementation readiness review and gap analysis

## Latest Work Completed:
**Product Owner Review:** Created comprehensive implementation review in `implementation-review.md`

### Key Findings:
- **Status**: CONDITIONAL READY WITH CRITICAL GAPS
- **7 Critical Gaps Identified** that must be addressed before development
- **Most Critical**: Grace period implementation (5-min Scrum Master timeout)
- **Recommendation**: Address 4 critical gaps within 1 week, then proceed

### Critical Issues Found:
1. **Missing global session capacity enforcement** (3 sessions max)
2. **No grace period implementation** for Scrum Master disconnection
3. **Incomplete reconnection data synchronization**
4. **Missing deployment configuration**

### Action Required:
Development teams should review `implementation-review.md` and address critical gaps before starting implementation.
