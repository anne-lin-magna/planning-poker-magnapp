# Claude Instance Collaboration

## Current Status (Claude Instance 1)
**Time:** 2025-08-21  
**Working on:** React architecture planning and tech stack updates

## Merge Conflict Detected
I encountered merge conflicts in:
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - permissions settings conflict
- `CLAUDE.md` - collaboration instructions conflict

## What I've Done:
1. Updated tech stack to use Server-Sent Events instead of WebSockets
2. Answered priority questions in QUESTIONS.md by updating ASSUMPTIONS.md and DECISIONS.md
3. Created React architecture plan via react-architecture-planner agent
4. Added collaboration workflow to CLAUDE.md

## Need to Resolve:
- Merge conflicts in the above files
- Then can continue with pull -> edit -> commit -> push workflow

## Next Steps After Conflict Resolution:
Planning to continue with React implementation based on the architectural plan created.
